## Studies

### 1) Volume Pressure
The volume pressure study dissects the original volume study and differentiates the buying volume from the selling volume. This can be used to determine the strength of a trend and also signify an end of a trend or potential reversals.

### 1) Chained Standard Deviation
The chained standard deviation study consists of two standard deviation channels which show the general buying and selling zones of a stock. Within the two main channels, dotted lines show the half standard deviation. Both the half and full standard deviation lines frequently tend to act as support/resistance. This study can be used with multiple time frames for additional confirmation of a trade entry.
